## Overview

[**Daring Mechanician** ](https://github.com/liebke/mechanician) is a Python library for building tools that use AI by building tools that AIs use.


## Create Tool Sets that be orchstrated by AI-Driven Programs 

* AIs can take structured output from search-oriented tools and reason over it providing natural language responses to users.

* Write tools that provide natural language error messages to the AI so it can learn from its mistakes and correct its reasoning.

* Write tools that provide sufficient feedback even during non-error responses so the AI can learn from its successes as well as its mistakes, allowing it to improve its understanding of how the tools work.

* Discover how an AI can reason across multiple tools, and how to write tools that provide feedback to the AI so it can learn from its mistakes.

* Build tool combinations that an AI can orchestrate to solve multi-step tasks.


## Evaluator AIs to Test AI-Driven Programs

* Using an Evaluator AI to evaluate natural-language responses from a Q & A oriented AI-Driven Program

* Using an Evaluator AI to automate the interaction with a task-oriented AI-Driven Program

* Using an Evaluator AI to speed up the process of Prompt Engineering for an AI-Driven Programs
  
  * Prompt Engineering is the process of refining the prompts used to interact with an AI-Driven Program to improve the quality of the responses.

  * Will end up refining the prompts for both the Evaluator AI and the AI-Driven Program, improving your understanding of the task and the AI's understanding of the task.





## Parallel Tool Calls and Streaming Responses

It currently supports [*OpenAI's Chat API*](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview) and [*OpenAI's Assistants API*](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview), and specifically supports [OpenAI's *Function Calling*](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling), a.k.a.```tool_calls```, while [*streaming responses*](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_stream_completions) from the *Chat API*. 

Each ```tool_call``` will be executed in a [```ThreadExecutor```](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html) as soon as it has completely streamed to the client, allowing it to perform *IO-bound* calls while other ```tool_calls``` continue to stream to the client.

## Getting Started

The [```examples```](https://github.com/liebke/mechanician/tree/main/examples) directory contains examples of **Daring Mechanician** projects.


## The Movie Database (TMDb) Example


### Create a Virtual Environment (optional)

Using [*Conda*](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#managing-python) for environment management:

```bash
conda create --name mechanician_tmdb_env
conda activate mechanician_tmdb_env
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
cd examples/tmdb
./install.sh
```


### Set Environment Variables

You will need an [**OPENAI_API_KEY**](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and a [**TMDB_READ_ACCESS_TOKEN**](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) to run the example.


```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE>
export TMDB_READ_ACCESS_TOKEN=<YOUR_TMDB_READ_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE>
```

### Run the Example

```bash
./run.sh
```

### Example Interaction

```markdown
> what was the first movie that the actor that plays Furiosa in the upcoming movie Furiosa star in?

Calling external function: search_movie...
Calling external function: get_movie_by_id...
Calling external function: get_movie_credits...
Calling external function: get_actor_credits...


The first movie that Anya Taylor-Joy, the actor who plays Furiosa in the upcoming movie "Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga," starred in was "The Witch," where she played the character Thomasin. The film was released in 2015.

> 
```


### TMDb Example Code

* [```examples/tmdb/main.py```](https://github.com/liebke/mechanician/blob/main/examples/tmdb/main.py): shows how to use **Daring Mechanician** to interact with *OpenAI's Chat API*, providing it with **tools** that can be used by the LLM to makes *callouts* to other programs. 

* [```tmdb_tool_schemas.py```](https://github.com/liebke/mechanician/blob/main/examples/tmdb/tmdb_tool_schemas.py): informs the LLM what tools are available to it.

* [```tmdb_tools.py```](https://github.com/liebke/mechanician/blob/main/examples/tmdb/tmdb_tools.py): is *function_handler* containing ```stub``` functions that are invoked when the LLM makes one or more ```tool_call``` requests.

* [```examples/tmdb/instructions.md```](https://github.com/liebke/mechanician/blob/main/examples/tmdb/instructions.md): is a set of instructions for the LLM that inform it of the tools available to it, and describe its role as a **Movie Database Assistant** that answers questions about movies and their casts and crews.

* [```tmdb_example_prompts.md```](https://github.com/liebke/mechanician/blob/main/examples/tmdb/tmdb_example_prompts.md): provides a variety of approaches to interacting with the LLM.

* [```examples/tmdb/test.py```](https://github.com/liebke/mechanician/blob/main/examples/tmdb/test.py): shows how to test **Daring Mechanician** programs by having the AI self-evaluate their responses given a testing rubric.

## Testing AI-Drive Programs Can Be... Interesting

Testing system that require user interaction can benefit from AI-driven testing. 

An Evaluator AI can be used to interact with the AI System Under Test (AISUT), eliciting responses that can be evaluated against a rubric.

Evaluating natural language responses against a rubric can be challenging, and it helps to use an AI to evaluate the responses.

If an AI is intended to solve a task involving many steps, it can be useful to use an Evaluator AI automate the interaction with the AISUT, and to evaluate the responses against a rubric.

If the task is expected to result in structured data matching a known outcome, normal testing procedures can be applied once the strucutred output has been completed through the Evaluators AI's interaction with the AISUT.

Once automation of the interaction with the AI has been implemented, you will be able to perform prompt-engineering to refine the interactions and responses of the AI.


### AI Q and A Program Tests

```python
from mechanician.testing import QandATest, run_q_and_a_evaluations

class TestAI(unittest.TestCase):

   def test_ai(self):
      ai = init_ai()
      evaluator_at = init_evaluator_ai()

                        expected="Anya Taylor-Joy"),
               QandATest(prompt="What is the name of the actor plays Ken in the Barbie movie?",
                        expected="Ryan Gosling"),
               QandATest(prompt="Who played Barbie?",
                        expected="Margot Robbie"),

                        expected="The Witch")]
            
      results, messages = run_q_and_a_evaluations(ai, tests, evaluator_ai)

      for result in results:
         self.assertEqual(result.evaluation, "PASS")
