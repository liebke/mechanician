I'd like to create a document containing the basic details of the movie "The Matrix", and I would like to create docs for top billed actors and directors as well. Can you help me with that?

can you provide the details for the top-billed actors and directors for the matrix?

I'd like you to write a positive review for the matrix and link it to the movie document, and then write positive reviews for the directors and actors you selected.
