-----
Bright-eyed, silly spark,
Ripleyâ€™s bark splits open skies,
Treats whisper, tails fly.

Bright eyes, silly grins,
Treats devoured, barks echo,
Joy in every step.

My wife's name is Rochelle, she's a scientist, loves to cook, she has written three books, and travels all over the world.

In a house where science and barks blend,
Lives Rochelle, on whom pups depend.
With books, pots, and pans,
She travels to distant lands,
A family of tails and tales without end.
