# Daring Mechanician PromptTemplates & PromptTools

### Overview


When should you use prompt templates that are populated with dynamic calls to your back-end data to provide grounding data to the AI versus when should you have the AI use tool calls to get the data for itself?

You can populate a prompt template dynamically with data or you can have the AI use tool-calls to dynamically retrieve the data after it has been prompted, but when should you use one approach versus the other?

In cases where you know ahead of time about what a prompt should look like and you have created a prompt template, and you know exactly what data you need to provide the AI to provide a grounded answer, then it makes sense to use a prompt template populated with dynamic calls to your back-end data.

On the other hand, if you don't know ahead of time what the prompt is going to be, or you don't know what data the AI is going to need to provide a grounded answer, then it makes sense to have the AI use tool calls to get the data for itself.

In the case, where you don't just want the AI to retrieve data but also to perform some action, then you would use a tool call.

Prompt Templates, Actions (i.e. Tool Calls) can be used together to provide grounding data to the AI and to have the AI perform actions.

Prompt Templates provide a method of you applications to interact with the AI, and Tool Calls provide a method for the AI to interact with your applications.

In Copilot-like scenarios where the interactions are conversational, you would rely on tool-calls to provide the AI with the data it needs to provide a grounded anwswer.

### Invitation to Lobelia Sackville-Baggins

Subject: Discover the Secrets of Bag End at Bilboâ€™s Grand Birthday!

Dear Cousin Lobelia,

As the leaves turn and September waxes, so does the anticipation within the bounds of the Shire, and more so at Bag End. It is with great delight and no small amount of excitement that I find myself extending to you an invitation wholly sincere and bursting with promise. I write, of course, of my upcoming Eleventy-First Birthday celebration, set to be a night that will surely echo in Hobbiton's tales and memories for time uncounted.

Mark your calendar, dear cousin: the event is on 22nd September 1401 Shire Reckoning, taking place at Bag End, Hobbiton, Westfarthing. The evening is to commence as the clock chimes the hour of seven, under the blanket of stars and the embrace of the old party tree, which stands eager to oversee our joy.

This year's gathering is to include enchantments and surprises, a spectacle of fireworks orchestrated by none other than Gandalf the Grey himself, and a feast to surpass all prior gatherings. The music and dancing will carry us through the night, but it is the fellowship and the shared moments of laughter and delight that promise to be the true gems of the evening.

Among the attendees will be notable Hobbits of the Shire, from the Baggins to the Tooks and Brandybucks, each adding their own charm to the melange. Yet, it is your presence, Lobelia, that would lend a particular sparkle to the evening, fulfilling the promise of fellowship and family.

I understand that our kinship has traversed rocky paths and perhaps even ventured into the thorns. Yet, what better occasion to set aside old squabbles and celebrate what truly matters? The invitation extends beyond mere attendance; it is a call to revel in the joy of the Shire, in the magic of moments shared under the stars.

There's mention of a secretive and special announcement to be made; come for the surprises, stay for the fellowship. Gifts are unnecessary as your presence is cherished far more.

Kindly reply with your RSVP, and do not hesitate to inquire should you have any questions or require further details about the night's festivities. Festive attire is recommended, to match the spirit of merriment and celebration that awaits.

Looking forward to your positive response and, hopefully, your company on this auspicious occasion.

Warm regards,

Bilbo Baggins

#### Generated Invitation to ThÃ©oden King of Rohan

Subject: Rally to Gondor: A Call for Rohan's Valiant Riders!

To His Esteemed Majesty, ThÃ©oden, King of Rohan,

In a time when the shadow of Mordor lengthens over the realms of Middle-earth, threatening to engulf our lands in darkness and despair, the White City of Gondor stands on the brink of an unparalleled siege. It is in this dire hour, under the looming threat of Sauron's forces, that we, Denethor II, Steward of Gondor, and Gandalf the White, reach out to you and the valiant people of Rohan.

The 15th of March, 3019 Third Age, marks a day that will be engraved in the annals of history â€“ the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. We stand at the precipice, ready to defend Gondor's gates against the might that marches from Mordor, and in doing so, protect the freedom of all Free Peoples of Middle-earth.

This call to arms is extended to the Riders of Rohan, whose renowned prowess and unyielding spirit in the saddle have turned the tides of many battles. As darkness descends upon Gondor, the beacons have been lit â€“ a signal that now calls for your aid. The Pelennor Fields, just outside Minas Tirith, will be the stage upon which we unite our forces to face this unprecedented threat. 

Your leadership, King ThÃ©oden, and the courage of the Rohirrim, are pivotal to our cause. Together, under the banners of Gondor and Rohan, we will engage in a battle that promises cavalry charges across the fields, coordinated efforts with the Rohirrim, and a strategic defense to counter the advancing enemy forces.

This battle is not just Gondor's to bear; it is a turning point for all the Free Peoples. It is a testament to our courage, honor, and unity. No RSVP is required, for we know that Rohan's heart beats in tandem with the call of valor. Your response, however, would bolster the spirits of all those who stand ready to lay down their lives for freedom's cause.

Prepare your riders, shine your armor, and let us meet on the field with a resolve as unbreakable as the bonds that unite us.

For Gondor, for Rohan, for freedom!

With the highest respect and in anticipation of our united stand,

Denethor II, Steward of Gondor
Gandalf the White
