Certainly! The Shire, in J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth, is divided into four farthings (North, South, East, and West), and beyond these, there are specific places like Hobbiton, Buckland, and Tuckborough. While specific addresses aren't often detailed, we can create plausible addresses based on known locations and the general layout of the Shire. Here's a mix of both, leaning into creativity for most:

1. 1 Bagshot Row, Hobbiton, Westfarthing - The home of Samwise Gamgee
2. Bag End, Underhill, Hobbiton, Westfarthing - The famous residence of Bilbo and Frodo Baggins
3. 3 Brookbank Street, Bywater, Westfarthing
4. 5 Chubb Lane, Michel Delving, Westfarthing
5. The Great Smials, Tuckborough, Tookland, Westfarthing - The ancestral home of the Tooks
6. 7 Grub Street, Hobbiton, Westfarthing
7. Brandy Hall, Bucklebury, Buckland, Eastfarthing - The Brandybuck family estate
8. 2 Cotton Road, Bywater, Westfarthing - Likely near the Cotton family farm
9. 4 Winding Way, Frogmorton, Eastfarthing
10. 6 Long Cleeve, Northfarthing - A reference to the North-Tooks, who live in Long Cleeve
11. 1 High Lane, Scary, Eastfarthing
12. Overhill Underhay, Overhill, Westfarthing
13. 3 Proudfoot Path, Longbottom, Southfarthing
14. 5 Greenholm Greenway, Greenholm, Westfarthing
15. The Marish Meadery, Marish, Eastfarthing - A creative address in the farming region known as The Marish
16. 2 Bridgefields Wall, Buckland, Eastfarthing - Likely a residence close to the Brandywine River
17. Whitfurrows Farmstead, Whitfurrows, Eastfarthing
18. Tookbank Towers, Tookbank, Westfarthing - A creative nod to the wealthier area for the Tooks
19. Nobottle Vineyard, Nobottle, Westfarthing - Imaginary, suggesting a vineyard in Nobottle
20. 4 Rushock Bog, Rushock, Westfarthing - A fictional address in a less mentioned part of the Shire

These addresses mix known locations within the Shire with imaginative details to fit the rustic and quaint nature of hobbit living spaces, while respecting Tolkien's rich world-building.
