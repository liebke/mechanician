In J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth, the Rings of Power were distributed among Elves, Dwarves, and Men. The specific names of all the recipients are not detailed for each of the Rings, especially for the Dwarves and Men, but here's a list combining known names from the lore with plausible created names for those not explicitly mentioned:

### Three Rings for the Elven-kings:
1. **Narya (The Ring of Fire)** - Given to Círdan, the Shipwright, who later passes it to Gandalf.
2. **Nenya (The Ring of Water)** - Possessed by Galadriel, Lady of Lothlórien.
3. **Vilya (The Ring of Air)** - Held by Gil-galad before being given to Elrond, Lord of Rivendell.

### Seven Rings for the Dwarf-lords:
1. **King Durin III of Khazad-dûm** - The only explicitly named Dwarf recipient in the lore.
2. **Thráin I** - Plausible, as the Rings were passed down through Durin's line, though not explicitly named as a recipient.
3. **Náin II** - A created name, fitting the pattern of significant Dwarven leaders.
4. **Dáin I** - Following the lineage of notable Dwarf-kings.
5. **Borin** - A plausible Dwarf-lord's name, inserted for continuity.
6. **Farin** - Invented, reflecting the common naming conventions among Dwarves.
7. **Grór** - A plausible name, aligning with the tradition of Dwarven names.

### Nine Rings for Mortal Men, doomed to die:
1. **Three were given to Númenóreans:**
   - **Isildur** - An extrapolation; while not a canonical recipient, his stature suggests potential.
   - **Anárion** - Created for symmetry with Isildur, as they were brothers and co-rulers.
   - **Ar-Pharazôn** - The last King of Númenor, plausible given his lust for power.
2. **Six were given to lords of Men:**
   - **Khamûl the Easterling** - One of the only explicitly named Ringwraiths, known as the Shadow of the East.
   - **Sorcerer of Dol Guldur** - A plausible title for one of the unnamed Nazgûl, inspired by their activities.
   - **The Witch-king of Angmar** - Leader of the Nazgûl, his previous identity before falling to the Ring's corruption is unknown.
   - **Lord of Rhûn** - Created name for a powerful leader in the East where Sauron had influence.
   - **Chieftain of the Haradrim** - A plausible recipient, representing Sauron's dominion in the South.
   - **A Lord of Umbar** - Reflecting the corrupted Númenórean colonies known for their piracy and opposition to Gondor.

This list blends established lore with creative license to fill gaps, adhering to the spirit of Tolkien's world. The real names and stories of many of these characters remain a mystery, allowing for imagination to fill the voids.
