**Product Offer Types**

To build a product offer, you use Hansen Catalog Manager to create a bundle, package or promotion, all described in Product Offer Entities. You can create a new product offer at any time, adding the required entities now, or you may choose to associate some entities as they become available in the system.

* Package: Combines two or more components from a single product line

* Promotion: Combines two or more components from a single product line, available for customers to buy on a promotional, time-limited basis

* Bundle: Combines multiple, distinct products and services to support a broad demand in the marketplace, using entities from one or more product lines, including other packages, components or component groups


* Bundle: The highest level of product offer, a bundle is a single saleable entity made up of any combination of the following types of lower-level entities:
    * Packages
    * Promotions
    * Components
    * Component groups
    * Bundles typically combine distinct products and services to support a broad demand in the marketplace and use entities from one or more product lines.

* Package: A package is a type of product offer made up of one or more components that are usually from a single product line.

* Promotion: A promotion, like a package or bundle, is a product offer available for customers to buy. 
    * A promotion is a special, time-sensitive offer, whereas bundles and packages form longer-running, standard product offers. Promotions give you a further way to categorize and promote offers on a time-limited basis.

* Component: A component is an individual element and reusable building block that you can combine with other components to build products for sale, namely packages, bundles, and promotions. A component can be a tangible item, such as a cellular phone, or an intangible item, for example, a service plan.
    * You can create individual components or N-tier components, which are components nested inside other components.

* Component Group: A component group is a structure that logically groups multiple components. Component groups are helpful for presenting a choice between different sets of components for a product offer. Like components, component groups are entities that must be approved to be available in packages, bundles and promotions. Component groups may contain components from a single component category or from across categories.


## Pricing Entities

* Charge: A charge defines the rating information for a product entity and the rules for how the rate is applied when the charge is associated with a product entity. A product entity with an associated charge can contain multiple rates based on different criteria for when a charge applies.

    * You can create the following types of charges:
        * EventCharge
        * RecurringCharge
        * NonRecurringCharge
        * StandaloneRecurringCharge
        * StandaloneNonRecurringCharge
        * RecurringCostBasedCharge
        * NonRecurringCostBasedCharge
